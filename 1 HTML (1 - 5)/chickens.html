			The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red
			junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl, originally from Southeastern
			Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male
			may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An
			adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called
			a pullet.

			Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
			were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries
			BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food
			(consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
